        <h1>DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT</h1>
        <p>As my favorite horror franchise, I was glad to complete my fan base short. I want to see Jason scaring a new generation of horror fans. But maintaining the old formula for a good slasher film: jump scares, chase scenes, and shocking kills. My short will get your heart pumping with adrenaline.</p>
        <p>Jason Z continue to be menace for camp counselors. But my twist is that Jason would be challenge and hunted for once. Jason became a target for another cruel entity and Jason does not have the upper advantage. Jason would demonstrate how strong he is to defend himself.</p> 
        <p>Horror fans would be delighted with my creative fusion of horror. I would hope that it would inspire another Friday 13th Film with more blood and gore. I know the fans are waiting for more.</p>
